# FancyPlaces
*Have you ever seen a nice shop or restaurant and said: "I have to come back here" - but never found it again?*

Well, then this App is for you: It lets you create a georeferenced list of your most favorite places, your **FancyPlaces**.  Create your new **FancyPlaces** on the go, when you discover a cool shop, square, cafe or restaurant. Add an image of your place representing it and store some notes. When you feel like rediscovering, just look at your list or map and find out where your **FancyPlaces** are!
